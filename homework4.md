GIT WORKFLOW FUNDAMENTALS

1. Working Directory -  is a workspace that you do the work 
and where you can add, modify or delete files. 

2. Staging Area - git add allows you to shift your files to the staging area. this
is for any changes or files that you are not ready to move to the git local repository.

3. Local Repo (head) - This is a git repository that its only accessible to you and is saved
on your computer. 

4. Remote repo (master) - This is repository allows other people to have access 
and make any changes to the repository and is stored in an external server. 


Working Directory States:

1. staged - When all changes to the file is done it moved to the staged state and 
the file is now able to be added to the local git database.

2. Modified - this is when any changes happen to the file and that the file has had
changes since the last commit which is saved to the local  database. 

3. committed - this indicates that the file has been safely stored in the local database.
