Question 1 

Product backlog refinement-  Backlog refinement is the process by which the product owner and some, or all, of the other team members go over the things on the backlog to make sure they are the right ones, that they are prioritised, and that the items at the top are ready for delivery. This requires regular meetings and is often an offical planned meeting. this will include topics such as
a through requirement analysis, an estimate of stories, how long new items will take and reevaluating how long it will take for existing products. 

Sprint Planning- scrum team assess this, how tasks are to be done for the sprint, this is presented and modified as needed.
they pick out items from the backlog and explain how they will implement them. 

Daily Scrum- Is a 15 minute meeting to assess development towards the sprint plan. The results for a daily scrum is usually 
to creat a plan for the following day, modify any obstacles and also for the team to
refine any issues. 

sprint review - is to examine the results of the sprint and then offer how this can be improved in the future. 
the scrum team show their work to the stake holders and talk over how this can be improved in the future.
product backlog are also usually reviewed to offer some fresh opportunities. 
attendees also decide how to move forward and what is need to do. 

sprint retrospective- is a continual meeting to discuss what went well and what can be done better next time, as well as what can be improved in the next
sprint. this meeting is for improving everyone and the products. 


ScrumMaster - An Agile development team's facilitator is called a Scrum Master. 
They are in charge of overseeing information sharing among team members as well as planning and letting know the team 
what can be done next. A team may communicate and self-organize using the Scrum project management framework to make changes rapidly.
they find new ways of implementing product goals. 

product Owner- The Scrum Product Owner oversees the product backlog and makes certain 
that the business derives the most value possible from a product. 
The Scrum Master assists the Scrum Product Owner
by: ensuring that each Scrum team member is aware of the objectives, 
project scope, and product domain. they are a point of contact for the customer. 

Development Team- they are responsible for product goals, developing and design the product and is usually a group of people. 
This team is in charge for the actual development of the product to reach the sprint goal. 


Question 2: 

This is a list of task for the yoga booking system and in the correct order: 

The development team would need to arrange a leader. who is then to organise the associates. 

Associate 1 - in charge of collecting and organise the date and design. e.g where and how to store the data. 
this is usually done by a class diagram.

associate 2-  Design relational database.

associate 3-  the third associate is able designing a database to store user info and booking information 
and times available to the customers. 

associate 4- front end of the system can be created, so that customers are able to book in a sign in to the system. 

associate 5- API endpoints can be created and worked on using the company's tech stack to interact
with the database. 


this will then be shown to the team and can be reviewed for any feedback. 

first two task need to be done within the first 2 weeks, and the remaining three can be developed later on. 

API Endpoints being created and interacting with the data can be worked on in parallel. 
design system and the relational database can also be worked on in parallel. 

Task 2-
 
Question 1- 

design a cinema booking system. 


1. Data collect is needed and a overview of design 

2. Design user interface to book seats and show what movies are playing in the cinema.

3. Relation database would be needed to show seat availability and which ones are occupied. 

4. Develop the back-end stories to allow this to link the user interface database, so that its 
able to show and to allow the api to show up displays of availability in regard to the user booking query. 

5. Testing the code for the user requirements. 


Key Requirements- 
-each movie having multiple showings
- what city and area you want to book in 
- customers being able to search what movies, times and dates they are playing.
- being able to pay online 
- showing customers the seating arrangements and being able to book multiple. e.g for a group of friends. 
- customer should be able to see which seats are booked and which ones are free. 
- system should not allow customers to book the same seat twice.
- 


main consideration- This could be that people book a seat but do not attend. 
this can be avoided by requiring people to pay online and once seats are confirmed customers have 
a 5 minute window to buy the tickets otherwise they are released back to other potential customers.

Common problem - This could be people make a reservation however they do not end up showing up. a solution for this could be 
developing a system which requires customers to login in to their accounts when making th reservation and if they do not end up attending 
after 2 times they can be removed from any futher bookings.
